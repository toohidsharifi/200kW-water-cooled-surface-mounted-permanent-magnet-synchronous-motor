As you know, the design process of electrical machines contains branches, including electromagnetic design, thermal design, mechanical design, vibration design, and drive system design. 
According to Juha Pyrhonen [1], the stuff of thermal design in electrical machines is much more complicated than the classic electromagnetic design.
Empirical constants are very popular in the field of electrical machines as machine designers usually don't have the specific ability to design the thermal circuits for the machine.
